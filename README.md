TicTacToe with deep learning 4j
===============================

This project provides three main classes FeedForwardTwoLayerMain.java, FeedForwardHiddenLayerMain.java  ConvolutionalNetMain.java with different net layouts.

Use your favorite IDE or build with mvn to execute the net learning with the present input and labels.

e.g. `mvn clean package` followed by `java -cp target/ch.evolutionsoft.dl.tictactoe-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar ch.evolutionsoft.example.dl4j.tictactoe.feedforward.FeedForwardHiddenLayerMain`

A little patience is needed for 50-100 training epochs.

Choose another net layout training execution with the alternative ch.evolutionsoft.example.dl4j.tictactoe.convolutional.ConvolutionalNetMain or ch.evolutionsoft.example.dl4j.tictactoe.feedforward.FeedForwardTwoLayerMain
